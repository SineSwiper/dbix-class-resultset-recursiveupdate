=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::ResultSet::RecursiveUpdate - like update_or_create - but recursive 


=head1 VERSION

This document describes DBIx::Class::ResultSet::RecursiveUpdate version 0.001


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    __PACKAGE__->load_namespaces( default_resultset_class => '+DBIx::Class::ResultSet::RecursiveUpdate' );

in the Schema file (see t/lib/DBSchema.pm).  Or appriopriate 'use base' in the ResultSet classes. 

Then:

    my $user = $user_rs->recursive_update( { 
        id => 1, 
        owned_dvds => [ 
        { 
          id => undef, 
          title => 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' 
        } 
        ] 
      }
    );

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can feed the ->create method with a recursive datastructure and have the related records
created.  Unfortunately you cannot do a similar thing with update_or_create - this module
tries to fill that void. 

It is a base class for ResultSets providing just one method: recursive_update
which works just like update_or_create but can recursively update or create
data objects composed of multiple rows. All rows need to be identified by primary keys
- so you need to provide them in the update structure (unless they can be deduced from 
the parent row - for example when you have a belongs_to relationship).  
When creating new rows in a table with auto_increment primary keys you need to 
put 'undef' for the key value - this is then removed
and a correct INSERT statement is generated.  

For a many_to_many (pseudo) relation you can supply a list of primary keys
from the other table - and it will link the record at hand to those and
only those records identified by them.  This is convenient for handling web
forms with check boxes (or a SELECT box with multiple choice) that let you
update such (pseudo) relations.

For a description how to set up base classes for ResultSets see load_namespaces
in DBIx::Class::Schema.

=head1 DESIGN CHOICES

=head2 Treatment of many to many pseudo relations

Matt Trout expressed following criticism of the support for many to many in
RecursiveUpdate and since this is an extension of his DBIx::Class I feel obliged to
reply to it.  It is about two points leading in his opinion to 'fragile and
implicitely broken code'. 

1. That I rely on the fact that

 if($object->can($name) and
             !$object->result_source->has_relationship($name) and
             $object->can( 'set_' . $name )
         )

then $name must be a many to many pseudo relation.  And that in a
similarly ugly was I find out what is the ResultSource of objects from
that many to many pseudo relation.

2. That I treat uniformly relations and many to many (which are
different from relations because they require traversal of the bridge
table).

To answer 1) I've refactored that 'dirty' code into is_m2m and get_m2m_source so
that it can be easily overridden.  I agree that this code is not too nice - but
currenlty it is the only way to do what I need - and I'll replace it as soon as
there is a more clean way.  I don't think it is extremely brittle - sure it will
break if many to many (pseudo) relations don't get 'set_*' methods anymore - but
I would say it is rather justified for this kind of change in underlying library
to break it.


Ad 2) - first this is not strictly true - RecursiveUpdate does have
different code to cope with m2m and other cases (see the point above for
example) - but it let's the user to treat m2m and 'normal' relations in a
uniform way.  I consider this a form of abstraction - it is the work that
RecursiveUpdate does for the programmer.


=head1 INTERFACE 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 recursive_update

The method that does the work here.

=head2 is_m2m

$self->is_m2m( 'name ' ) - answers the question if 'name' is a many to many
(pseudo) relation on $self.

=head2 get_m2m_source

$self->get_m2m_source( 'name' ) - returns the ResultSource linked to by the many
to many (pseudo) relation 'name' from $self.
